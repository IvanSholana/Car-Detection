# YOLOv8 Car Detection ðŸš—

## Overview
This repository contains code for training a YOLOv8 model for car detection using the Ultralytics YOLOv8 framework. The model is trained on a custom dataset of car images using the Roboflow platform for data preprocessing. With the increasing demand for efficient and accurate object detection systems, particularly in the domain of autonomous vehicles, traffic monitoring, and surveillance, this project aims to provide a robust solution for detecting cars in images.

## Motivation ðŸš€
The motivation behind this project stems from the need for robust and efficient car detection systems in various domains, including transportation, public safety, and urban planning. By leveraging the power of deep learning and the YOLOv8 architecture, we aim to provide a solution that can accurately detect cars in diverse environments and lighting conditions, paving the way for safer and more efficient transportation systems.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolov8-car-detection.git
    cd yolov8-car-detection
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install ultralytics==8.0.196 roboflow==1.1.27
    ```
## Usage
1. Set up your Roboflow account and generate an API key.
2. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'`, `'WORKSPACE'`, and `'PROJECT'` with your actual Roboflow API key, workspace name, and project name respectively in the code.
3. Run the code to download the dataset from Roboflow, preprocess it, and train the YOLOv8 model.
4. Monitor the training progress and evaluate the model's performance.
